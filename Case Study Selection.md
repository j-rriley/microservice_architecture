## Why this? 
This option first sparked my interest because Etsy is a site I frequently use, and upon examining the task further, learning that it is a comparative study
between two large companies is very exciting. We previously did a blog post about the difficulty of adapting to microservices, so I believe it will be 
very interesting and informative to study and give a presentation on. Upon skimming the article linked, it opens up in an interesting discussion about what
the real difference is between monoliths and microservices, and how that differs on paper vs in the real world. I will be very interested to learn more!
