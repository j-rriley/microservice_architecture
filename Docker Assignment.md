### Docker Assignment
In this assignment, we were tasked to install Docker and run an existing container. Since this application is new to me, I decided to walk through the tutorial and use that as
the container I show running.

Above, you can see that there is a container running on port 3000 of my local device.

Above, you can see the existing images I have on my computer. 

![The application running.](/images/app_running.png)
Above, you can see the application running on port 3000. 


In this exercise, I have learnt to build an app's container image and start an app container. This is a good practice because a container is a process that has been isolated
isolated from all other processes on the host machine, therefore having its own collection of resources. Docker makes this a simple process.
