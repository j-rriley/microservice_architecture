## **STEP ONE:** 

My business, GotWeb, is a web design company that specializes in creating user-friendly websites for artists all over the world. 
We take our clients from the beginning of the process to the end in merely 2 weeks, from choosing a domain name, building the user interface, 
adding their content, creating a mailing list, and finally hosting the website online. We also ensure that our artists are able to manage and
maintain their website once it is up and running, and have customer support available in case issues arise. Rather than having to learn about 
web development extensively or simply passing the website off to a third party, GotWeb aims to provide personal and professional assistance to
those looking to create a portfolio site so that they are able to have more control without spending extra time. 


## **STEP TWO:** 

#### Description of flow

The journey in this diagram shows how easy GotWeb makes it for an artist to have and maintain their own website. When an artist comes to one 
of our web developers, they come equipped with their own domain name idea and content for their web page. Our web developers go on to set up 
the website, which the artist also has access to in order to upload and maintain their content. There are customer support agents waiting at 
the ready in case an issue arises with the website, and the artist is able to be connected to their clients. 

## **STEP THREE:**

   As seen by the above diagram, the bounded contexts of our design lies between two modules: the content piece and the development piece. While 
the content piece drives the web feature additions, ultimately both pieces are being pushed directly to the website created. 
  
  When creating content, we will gather three components, which are the media of art, the observation piece, and feedback from clients in order 
to create a content addition. These are added directly to the website but help to define the need for web app additions. 
  
  On the development side, we will need a content management system, CMS, and a web hosting service that will both aid in creating web feature
additions. These are added directly to the website and help to piece together the UI.
