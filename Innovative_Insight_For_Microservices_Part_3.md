#### Innovative Insight for Microservices: Recommendations
##### Jaime Riley and Quentin Novinger

  This section of the article provides recommendations for companies that are looking to integrate microservices architecture into their technologies through the structure of 
questions ‘when’, ‘who’, and ‘how’. 


  Beginning with when, it is important for teams to determine if they are able to have a disruption in current practices caused by the need to build their infrastructure 
from divided parts. Since there is no cohesive design presently available, an organization has to use open-source technologies in order to construct their own architecture 
product. This can be time-consuming, costly, and overall difficult for those who do not have needed resources. 


  Leading into who, an organization must also determine who will take responsibility for the project within their company. The article suggests creating a ‘platform ops’ team 
to manage this process, with their primary responsibilities being the construction and management of infrastructure components.


  Finally, looking at how, an organization is tasked to select and join together the major components of microservices architecture: a managed container platform, service mesh,
API gateway technologies, observability services, and persistence and event brokering technologies. To choose a managed container platform, the team must look at their needs
and capabilities to decide on using cloud-hosted services or on-premises software, and PaaS, claaS, or fPaaS. This also affects the service mesh decision, since it must be 
compatible with the selected managed container platform along with other components. Therefore, it is suggested that a team chooses a service mesh with noninvasive technologies 
and polyglot language environments. For the API gateway technologies, it is important to consult the current API gateway vendor about their plans to add microgateway and service
mesh support to the current practice, looking for solutions with the ability to specify security and traffic management rules using declarative policies. Then, it is suggested
to get observability services that provide environment visibility, allowing for error logging, diagnostics and container-aware monitoring. Finally, for persistence and event 
brokering technologies, the article suggests getting services that support the Open Service Broker API.
