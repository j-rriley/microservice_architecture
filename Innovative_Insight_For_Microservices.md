## Innovative Insight for Microservices 
#### Jaime Riley

When starting the reading, I was instantly surprised at the following statistic: "By 2022, 70% of organizations that attempt to adopt microservices will have found the effort too disruptive and will have switched to miniservices instead." With this article aiming to provide insight to those interested in microservices, it seemed like a discouraging start to those looking to apply this design architecture into their organization. However, getting into the details of why microservices are disruptive, such as their technical and cultural impact, need for competency in agile and DevOps, its new and complex application infrastructure, and more, it is clear why major companies in business markets are the main proponents of microservices adoption. It is still in its early stages of adoption, but many leading organizations like Amazon, Ebay, Netflix, Twitter, etc. have made the investment due to its many benefits. Microservice adoption delivers better agility and scalability than any other design architecture, and provides many other benefits that we talked about in our previous class. It seems that the major issues holding many back is the risk of disruption due to the many prerequisites and its cultural impact. This article does supply a path to adopt microservices architecture, which seems like a process that takes a good amount of time along with expertise.
